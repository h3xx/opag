Description: Command line option parser generator
 Opag, which stands for "Option Parser Generator", is a program to
 generate C or C++ code which parses command line options. It takes as
 input a description of the command line options you want your program
 to support. The output is a C or C++ function which finds these options
 in an array of strings (typically "argv", the second parameter of the
 "main" function) and sets variables accordingly. Short (single
 character) as well as long (GNU style) options are supported.
 .
 It is also possbile to associate a help string with each option. Opag
 uses these to create a macro which expands to a string containing a
 nicely formatted description of the options.
